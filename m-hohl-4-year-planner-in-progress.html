            <br>College is a time to open your mind to new ideas. And your coursework is a part of that. Personally, the thought of expanding my horizons by exploring a variety of subjects excites me. In fact, I'm someone who reads the course catalog in my free time! But not all students share my enthusiasm, and many others feel locked into an educational system in which their academic career consists of a simple checklist and jumping through hoops. As we reflected on this, our project expanded. It wasn't just about graduating in four years; it was about giving students agency over their academic career.</p>

            <br>Using a combination of interviews, quantitative survey data, and competitive analysis, we gained insight into students patterns, frustrations, and goals. Throughout our initial interviews, we heard students repeatedly&nbsp;express sentiments like this one: "Four year plans are difficult to make, but they give me a sense of security."&nbsp;With findings like this, we knew&nbsp;we had uncovered a problem space, so we proceeded to collect data.</p>

            <br>Through our needfinding process,&nbsp;we came up with design goals (which became design challenges!). Each were based on our research findings. Here are three of them:</p>
          <div class="w-richtext challenge">
            <h4><strong>Challenge:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Students need to keep track of course requirements and prerequisites.</strong></h4>
            <p>In data collection, we found that keeping track of course requirements across many categories (such as their major, minor, electives, and general education) presents a challenge for most students.&nbsp;How could we consolidate all this information into a digestible format? Additionally, if a student mistakenly plans on taking a course they haven't fulfilled the prerequisite for, it can set them back an entire year. How might we prevent that from happening?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="w-richtext challenge">
            <h4><strong>Challenge:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Flexibility in planning is imperative.</strong></h4>
            <p>We found that students are constantly changing their 4 year plans. But the current tool for making a 4 year plan provided by the school has zero flexibility. How do we make changing a plan simple?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="w-richtext challenge">
            <h4><strong>Challenge:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Planning requires knowing which classes will be offered and when they will be offered.</strong></h4>
            <p>Some classes are offered ever quarter, others only once a year. Students need to know which classes are offered and when so that they can plan accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

After collecting their feedback and a few design iterations, we developed medium fidelity clickable&nbsp;prototypes with Sketch +&nbsp;InVision. Finally, we tested the effectiveness of our design by giving the users a task to accomplish on our prototype and observing how they went about doing it.</p><img src="images/4yearPic-proto2.png" class="photo-here">
