            <h4>01. Problem Space</h4>
            <p>How might we empower students to have greater&nbsp;agency over their academic careers and graduate within four years?</p>
            <p>In the course of ten weeks, myself and 3 others sought to improve the UC San Diego student experience by redesigning the 4 year planner - a tool for students to map out coursework and stay on track to graduate in 4 years.</p>
            <h4>02. Research&nbsp;</h4>
            <p>Using a combination of interviews, surveys, and competitive analysis, we gained insight into students patterns, frustrations, and goals. Throughout our initial interviews, we heard students repeatedly&nbsp;express sentiments like this one: "Four year plans are difficult to make, but they give me a sense of security."&nbsp;With findings like this, we knew&nbsp;we had uncovered a problem space, so we proceeded to collect data.</p>
            <p>Emergent Questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What challenges do students face in making 4 year plans?</li>
              <li>What information is required to make a 4 year plan?</li>
              <li>What are current methods and tools for students to make a 4 year plan?</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>03. Design Objectives + Challenges</h4>
            <p>Through our needfinding process,&nbsp;we came up with a few design goals:</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Students need to keep track of course requirements and prerequisites.&nbsp;</strong>In data collection, we found that keeping track of course requirements across many categories (such as their major, minor, electives, and general education) presents a challenge for most students.&nbsp;How could we consolidate all this information into a digestible format? Additionally, many courses are prerequisite courses that must be taken beforehand. If a student mistakenly plans on taking a course they haven't fulfilled the prerequisite for, it can set them back an entire year. How might we prevent that from happening?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Flexibility in planning is imperative.</strong>We found that students are constantly changing their 4 year plans. But the current tool for making a 4 year plan provided by the school has zero flexibility. How do we make changing a plan simple?</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Planning requires knowing which classes will be offered and when they will be offered.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Some classes are offered ever quarter, others only once a year. Students need to know which classes are offered and when so that they can plan accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
          </div>
          <h4>04. Prototyping</h4>
          <p>We put our paper prototypes in front of people and probed them with questions to check for understanding. After collecting their feedback and a few design iterations, we developed medium fidelity clickable&nbsp;prototypes with Invision. Finally, we tested the effectiveness of our design by giving the users a task to accomplish on our prototype and observing how they went about doing it.</p>
