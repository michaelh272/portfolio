            <br>How might we allow designers and coders to more easily connect to collaborate on software based projects? We're so often broken up into our separate disciplines or majors that finding experts outside your own field presents a challenge.</p>

            <br>Our user interviews sought to discover more about the relationship between designers and coders: <em data-new-link="true">"What made for good partnerships? How do designers currently find programmers? What do programmers look for in designers?"&nbsp;</em>
            <br>By conducting interviews, we gained insight into questions like these. We also found that many of our peers had difficulty finding people to work with outside their own discipline, providing evidence that our project did indeed address a need. We also did critical analysis to see how we could improve upon existing solutions.</p>

            <br>We began ideation by having each team member make their our own paper prototypes. We came together and discussed different elements of each, and then combined our different versions into a single comprehensive paper prototype.
            <br>We did some guerrilla user-based testing by camping out in the library and offering free candy to participants. (College students love any kind of free food.) Our data collection included notes, audio, and video footage. We compiled all the feedback we had received by sorting it into categories based on the product’s features and screens.
            <br>Our data served as valuable critique&nbsp;for our product. Challenging our designs&nbsp;became critical at this stage: <em data-new-link="true">“What’s a better way to visually display one’s skills on their profile? Is it valuable to include one’s time commitments on their profile?”</em>
            <br>As we discussed and sketched out our responses to questions like these, we worked to&nbsp;address the design challenges that arose during user testing.</p>

Design Challenge: Search Feature <br></strong></span><em data-new-link="true">"How do people search for teammates? What are they looking for? What criteria can we focus on to make their search as effortless as possible?"</em> &nbsp;These questions became critical as we focused on designing a search feature that would deliver the best user experience possible. After further research and a few redesigns, our search bar included filtering by location, skills needed (Photoshop, web dev, etc.) and project key word descriptors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Design Challenge: Skills UI<br></strong></span><em data-new-link="true">"How might users input the skills they have? Should users have to rate themselves on their proficiency in each skill? Should every single skill be displayed on a user's profile?"</em>&nbsp;During our initial research, we found that oftentimes designers don't know what a programmers skill means, and vice versa. (If a programmer says they're JavaScript expert, does a designer know what that really means?) Yet we also found that people based their teammate selections largely on their perceived skill level. We iterated through multiple redesigns before finalizing these UI elements.</p>

We wanted to maintain consistency across our website, so we made master elements and a “style guide” to ensure that we use uniform fonts and coloring. Our developers were able to take our Axure prototypes and turn our designs into working webpages - the project is finally coming to life!</p>
